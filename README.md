# CIS445: Hacktoberfest 2018

* Objective: For CIS 445 to try out Pull on GitHub. You will learn how to contribute to the Open Source projects.

* Reference: https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com

## Rules

* Rules: (from Hacktoberfest page)

> To get a shirt, you must make five pull requests (PRs) between October 1â€“31 in any timezone. PRs can be to any public repo on GitHub, not just the ones highlighted. The PR must contain commits you made yourself (not to your own repo). PRs reported by maintainers as spam or that are automated will be marked as invalid and won't count towards the shirt. This year, the first 50,000 of you can earn a T-shirt (compared with 30,000 in 2017).

## What to do?

1. **Fork** the project (click the **Fork** icon on the top-right corner of the project page)
2. Clone the project to your machine 
` git clone [the URL in your forked repo] ` 
3. Make some changes in your local repo, commit the changes, and push to your GitHub repo.
4. Go back to your GitHub page for the **forked** repo. Now, click the **Pull requests" tab followed by clicking the **New pull request** button (the green one)
5. Check the info in the pull request and see if everything looks alright, then click the **Create pull request** button (also the green one)

* Note: Here, you can make a little bit observation that the **base fork** is **CSIS-BU/CIS445-Hacktoberfest**, and the **base** is **master**, while the part that you request to merge into the base fork is from **[your id]/CIS445-Hacktoberfest18**

6. Once you submit your pull request, your request will be checked to verify if it is OK (means no conflict to the existing code.)
7. The maintainer(s) of the open source projects (in this case, me) will check your code and determine whether your code fits into the existing project and provides the functions without causing other issues. Once verified, your code will be merged to the corresponding (maybe master) branch so other developers can also have the access to the updated code.

## What to submit?

1. For your pull requests, each team will first create a folder using your project's name. For example, **team-1** or **daelyn-and-natalia**.

2. Under the folder, you'll put your milestones and issues in each milestones in the following format:

* Milestone Week 1
    * Issue 1:
    * Issue 2:
    * Issue 3:
    * ...
* Milestone Week 2
    * Issue 1:
    * Issue 2:
    * Issue 3:
    * ...
* Milestone Week 3
    * Issue 1:
    * Issue 2:
    * Issue 3:
    * ...

3. The same milestones and issues should be reflected to your original project

4. Note that your milestones and issues may change (the nature of a project), so you are allowed to change, modify, and move issues around if necessary. But, you should think a bit thoroughly in terms of your capability. _You don't just move the issues when the due arrives and you just cannot finish it._ **Consider milestones and issues are your contract with the group which funds your project.** If you do not deliver, you lose your fund, reputation, and possibly your job. So, think twice before you jump.

5. Now go back to your project. We now plan to extend the project for another _three weeks_ starting from today (Oct. 18), and this time you have deliverables **every single week** instead of just a big load of work at the very end. Considering that I am your manager and I check your GitHub to verify if you are really contributing to the team, as well as making good progress, you would like to be more serious this time.
**Your project grade will be built up based on your cumulative work instead of a day of work.**

6. In the coming weeks, we will introduce Design Patterns, Refactoring, and other programming techniques that are common practices if you are a software engineer. You can actually put together what you have learned in class into practice.
